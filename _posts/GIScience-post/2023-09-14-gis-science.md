As Wright et al. explain in their 1997 article GIS: Tool or science? Demystifying the persistent ambiguity of GIS as “tool” versus “science”, GIS can be practiced and perceived as a scientific tool, toolmaking for science, or as a science itself [@wright1997demystifying, pp. 354]  After reading the article and reflecting on my own experience with GIS, I think that while I have predominantly experienced GIS as a tool throughout my academic career, I am increasingly attuned to the merit of and swayed by perceiving GIS as a science within itself. Like many students, I first came into contact with GIS through taking GEOG120, where students learn about the myriad of tools in the Processing Toolbox and how to apply them to a given spatial problem. Before I studied Geography, I came from a more computational background, where many of the “data problems” I faced in GIS I could imagine a workflow for at least parts of in Python or R. Thus, I perceived GIS as just another method to achieve the results I could work towards using another technical tool. However, as more time passed, I found myself increasingly interested in the unique capabilities GIS provides to solving spatial problems. Quickly, I began turning to GIS to aid some of my pursuits in Computer Science, drafting out workflows and relying on tools such as Group By.

I think it is interesting to consider GIS to be a process, and the process of designing a workflow, or developing and improving tools to be a science. I do agree with Wright et al. that GIS enables the scientific process of hypothesis testing, of describing, explaining and predicting, and of understanding the world. It is “an environment as well as a method used to discover, explore, and test spatial theory” (Wright et al., 1997). I think that through using GIS, I have had the chance to both ask spatial problems and work towards understanding and answering them, which to me, is what science is all about.\
